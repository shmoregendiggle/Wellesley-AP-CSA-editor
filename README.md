# Wellesley-AP-CSA-editor
This Python application allows users to seamlessly download starter code from Canvas, edit and run code from within the editor, and submit projects to canvas, all from within the editor. This project was created for Wellesley High School students and still isn't fully complete. This project makes use of Instructure's Canvas API in order to download the starter code and to access the links to the instruction documents. From the links, Gdown downloads the instructions into text files that can be read from within the editor. The app uses Selenium to generate a Canvas API token from the user's canvas username and password. The App uses Tkinter to display the front end.
